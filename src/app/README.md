# React Application Layer

## Overview

Executive-friendly React Flow visualization of GraphQL schema relationships, built with Material-UI for a clean, business-focused interface. This application layer consumes pre-processed data from the backend pipeline and renders it as an interactive graph with advanced filtering, search, and exploration capabilities.

## Architecture

                   InfoPanel
```

## Data Flow

1. **Input**: ReactFlowData from backend pipeline (`extractGraph` → `toReactFlow`)
2. **State Management**: React hooks manage filters, search query, and selected node
3. **Filtering**: `useFilteredGraph` applies visibility rules based on filter state
4. **Search**: `useSearch` highlights matching nodes and pans viewport to first match
5. **Styling**: Computed styles applied (opacity, selection, highlighting)
6. **Rendering**: React Flow renders custom MUI nodes with interactive edges
7. **Interactions**: User clicks, filters, searches, pans, and zooms

### Data Transformation Pipeline

```
Backend Pipeline
----------------
mock_data.json (Nautobot introspection)
        ↓
extractGraph() → TypeGraph
        ↓
toReactFlow() → ReactFlowData { nodes, edges }
        ↓
React Application
-----------------
App.tsx loads ReactFlowData
        ↓
SchemaVisualizer receives { initialNodes, initialEdges }
        ↓
useFilteredGraph() → Filtered { nodes, edges }
        ↓
useSearch() → Set<highlightedNodeIds>
        ↓
Styled nodes with opacity/selection
        ↓
ReactFlow renders visualization
```

## Key Design Decisions

### MUI over Tailwind CSS

**Rationale**:
- Rich component library (Drawer, Card, Chip, AppBar, Switch)
- Built-in theming system with `createTheme()`
- Accessibility features out of the box (ARIA labels, focus management)
- Professional, executive-friendly aesthetic without custom CSS
- Consistent design language across components
- Smaller learning curve for Material Design familiarity

**Trade-offs**:
- Larger bundle size vs. Tailwind's utility-first approach
- Less customization flexibility vs. Tailwind's granular control
- Accepted for faster development and polished UX

### State Management Strategy

**Approach**: React hooks without external state management library

**Rationale**:
- Application state is local and UI-focused (no global app state needed)
- No Redux/Zustand overhead for simple use case
- Props drilling is minimal due to good component composition
- Performance optimized with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Easier to test and reason about

**State Ownership**:
- `SchemaVisualizer`: Owns filter state, search query, selected node, sidebar visibility
- `useFilteredGraph`: Derives filtered graph from filters
- `useSearch`: Derives highlighted nodes from search query
- React Flow: Manages node positions and viewport internally

### Responsive Layout

**Three-Panel Design**:
1. **Left Sidebar** (280px): Filter controls (collapsible)
2. **Center Canvas** (flexible): React Flow visualization
3. **Right Drawer** (360px): Node details panel (conditional)

**Features**:
- Smooth transitions when panels open/close (200ms ease)
- Canvas adapts with margin adjustments
- Persistent left sidebar, temporary right drawer
- MiniMap and zoom controls for large graphs
- Mobile-friendly design (future enhancement)

### Performance Optimizations

**Memoization**:
- `useFilteredGraph`: Memoized filtering with dependency array
- `useSearch`: Effect only runs when query or nodes change
- `styledNodes`: Computed via `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- `nodeTypes`: Stable reference prevents React Flow re-initialization

**Efficient Data Structures**:
- Set for O(1) node ID lookups in filtering
- Set for O(1) highlight checks in search
- Single-pass filtering algorithms
- No nested loops in hot paths

## Components Overview

### SchemaVisualizer
Main application container that orchestrates state, hooks, and rendering.

**Responsibilities**:
- Manage filter state (show/hide relationships and types)
- Manage UI state (search query, selected node, sidebar visibility)
- Apply filters and search via custom hooks
- Compute connection counts for selected nodes
- Render layout with sidebars and canvas

### CustomNode
Custom React Flow node component rendering types as MUI Cards.

**Features**:
- Color-coded by type kind (OBJECT, INTERFACE, UNION, etc.)
- Kind badge (small chip in corner)
- Preview of first 3 fields with "+N more" indicator
- Hover and selection states with elevation/border
- Compact, readable design (180-280px width)

### Controls
Left sidebar with filter toggles for relationship and node visibility.

**Filter Categories**:
- **Relationships**: Field edges, Implements, Union members
- **Node Visibility**: Hide built-ins, Hide Relay types

**UX**: Descriptive labels, Switch toggles, collapsible drawer

### SearchBar
Top navigation bar with search input and menu toggle.

**Features**:
- Case-insensitive substring search
- Clear button when query present
- Menu hamburger to toggle filter sidebar
- App title branding

### InfoPanel
Right-side drawer showing detailed information for selected node.

**Displayed Data**:
- Type name (large, color-coded)
- Kind badge and metadata flags (Relay, Built-in)
- Description text
- Connection statistics (incoming/outgoing edges)
- Complete field list (scrollable)

## Hooks Overview

### useFilteredGraph
Applies filter rules to nodes and edges, returning only visible elements.

**Algorithm**:
1. Filter nodes by `hideBuiltIns` and `hideRelay` flags
2. Create Set of visible node IDs
3. Filter edges by visibility and relationship type
4. Return filtered graph

**Performance**: Memoized with `[nodes, edges, filters]` dependencies

### useSearch
Case-insensitive search with auto-pan to first match.

**Algorithm**:
1. Normalize query to lowercase
2. Filter nodes by substring match on label
3. Create Set of matching node IDs
4. Pan viewport to first match with smooth animation

**Performance**: Effect runs only when `searchQuery` or `nodes` change

## Integration Points

### Backend Pipeline
**Imports**:
```typescript
import { extractGraph } from '../graph/extractGraph';
import { toReactFlow } from '../visualization/toReactFlow';
import mockData from '../data/mock_data.json';
```

**Usage**:
```typescript
const graph = extractGraph(mockData);
const reactFlowData = toReactFlow(graph);
```

### Data Contract
The application expects `ReactFlowData` with:
- `nodes`: Array of `CustomReactFlowNode` with pre-computed positions
- `edges`: Array of `CustomReactFlowEdge` with pre-applied styles

No transformation required - data consumed as-is from pipeline.

### Future API Integration
Replace static import with API call:
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/schema');
const introspectionData = await response.json();
const graph = extractGraph(introspectionData);
const reactFlowData = toReactFlow(graph);
```

- No memory leaks (React hooks clean up effects)
- React Flow manages virtual rendering

## Future Enhancements

### Features
- **Export**: PNG/SVG export, DOT format, JSON download
- **Layouts**: Hierarchical (top-down), force-directed, manual positioning
- **Advanced Search**: Regex support, multi-field search, search history
- **Domain Filtering**: Group by domain (network, admin, infrastructure)
- **Path Highlighting**: Show path between two selected nodes
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: '/' for search, 'Esc' to clear, arrow keys to navigate

### UX Improvements
- **Mobile Responsive**: Touch gestures, bottom sheet for mobile
- **Dark Mode**: Theme toggle with dark-optimized colors
- **Onboarding**: Interactive tour for first-time users
- **Settings Panel**: Customize layout, colors, default filters
- **Tooltips**: Hover tooltips on edges showing field names

### Performance
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large field lists
- **Debounced Search**: Reduce re-renders on fast typing
- **Web Workers**: Offload filtering for 500+ node graphs
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy load InfoPanel and Controls

## Contributing

When adding new features to the app layer:

1. **Types First**: Define TypeScript types in `types/graph.ts`
2. **Hooks for Logic**: Separate business logic into custom hooks
3. **Components for UI**: Keep components focused on presentation
4. **MUI Components**: Use MUI library components for consistency
5. **Performance**: Use `useMemo`/`useCallback` for expensive operations
6. **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard support
7. **Documentation**: Update relevant README files

## Key Takeaways

### Architecture Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Hooks for logic, components for presentation
2. **Data Flow**: Unidirectional from pipeline → state → hooks → rendering
3. **Composition**: Small, focused components composed into larger features
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode catches errors at compile time
5. **Performance**: Memoization and efficient data structures
